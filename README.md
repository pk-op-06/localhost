# localhost
A fast localhost browser that can be used as an alternate browser for your local testing.

## Why?
While running angular on my local on vscode + (chrome or firefox), it just hangs my pc like hell.<br>
Looked for many alternatives or optimizations like Great Suspender, etc. But the results were not so good enough. My PC was still hanging frequently.<br>
So, while discussing this issue, one of my senior just gave a solution for this problem saying -> <br>
<strong>"So develop your own browser na..."</strong>,<br>
as Chrome and Firefox were consuming a lot of memory(RAM) as we used to open many tabs and as a result for this, it just consumes a lot.

This browser will definetely consumes way much less than what others are.
I have developed it using [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), so few things are not in place yet.

DONT WORRY!! I am working on it and soon these will be rectified (if electron gives any support for it :P)

Currently working on optimization of this browser for the best alternative experience for the devs, and I AM OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS for this project.
